# LineFollower

Arduino based project of a bot that follows a black line

**Hardware Components Used**:
- Arduino Uno
- DC Motors
- Motor Driver L298N
- IR Sensors


**Uses**
1. *Arduino Uno*: Arduino is a microcontroller that is used as an intermediate between the sensor and the motors. The behaviour of the matters can be changed based on the sensor readings with the help of arduino board.

2. *DC Motors*: The movement of the bot was done using the motors.

3. *Motor Driver L298N*: The motor driver is used to control the speed and the timing of the motor.

4. *IR Sensors*: A black strip was used as the path that the bot was supposed to follow. The IR sensors are used to detect the existance of the black tape.
